My name is Tim DuBois and I'm presently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Stockholm Resilience Centre](http://www.stockholmresilience.org/) in Stockholm, Sweden. This is quite a recent appointment&mdash;most definitely still in the knowledge absorption stage. The outlook though is to increase our understanding of the so-called climate tipping points (such as the ice caps melting): how and when this may occur, what are the environmental and social actions or ramifications. Previously, I was at Chalmers University of Technology with the [Electromagnetic Field Theory Group](http://ft.nephy.chalmers.se) in Gothenburg, Sweden. The research I completed there was part of the PLasma based ION Acceleration (PLIONA) Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation project, which attempts to generate high acceleration laser-plasma based ion sources for near future use in applications such as hadron therapy for cancers, cosmic radiation studies on living cells and spacecraft, short-life medical isotope production, proton imaging and many other important applications.

I obtained my doctorate at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia in September 2015 with the [Chemical and Quantum Physics Group](http://tcqp.science). That research focused on microscopic models of defects and quantum transport in condensed matter systems and large scale computer simulation using *ab initio* techniques. From August 2009 until September 2015 I was also contracted by the [Defence Science and Technology Organisation](http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/) (now DST Group); specialising in statistical properties of Lagrangian particles in application to the areas of turbulent dispersion, release characterisation and blast dynamics.

Lazarus Long, a character is Robert Heinlein's *Time Enough for Love* stated that "Specialization is for insects"&mdash;a sentiment which I tend to embrace, with qualifications and academic training in Ancient Languages, Philosophy, Electronics, Ecology, and Computer Science along side Physics.

Outside of academic pursuits; my interests include [travelling](https://odyssey.neophilus.net), rock climbing, trampoline gymnastics, vertical farming & areoponics, [building multirotor uavs](https://www.exactlyinfinite.com/phoenix), [building stupid shit](https://cqplabs.neophilus.net/), [art](https://www.neophilus.net/whispers/) and making friends with neighbourhood cats.
